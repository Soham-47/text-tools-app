## 🧹 Code Guidelines

- Use **standalone components** and **Angular Signals**
- Apply **Tailwind CSS** for all styles
- Name files and folders in English (e.g., `text-tool`, `copy-button`)
- Follow the existing structure in `components/` and `pages/`

---

## ✅ Coding Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer `signal()` over `EventEmitter` where possible
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use modern Angular control flow like `@if`
